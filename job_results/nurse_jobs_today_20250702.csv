**About the Team**


Providence has a long history of serving Alaska, beginning when the Sisters of Providence first brought health care to Nome in 1902 during the Gold Rush. This pioneering spirit set the standard for modern health care in Alaska and formed the foundation for Providence's growth as the state's largest private employer and leading health care provider.


Our award\\-winning and comprehensive medical centers are located in Anchorage, Eagle River, Kodiak Island, Mat\\-Su, Seward, and Valdez. Our not\\-for\\-profit network also provides a full spectrum of care with leading\\-edge diagnostics and treatment, outpatient health centers, physician groups and clinics, outreach programs, and hospice and home care.


Providence is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to the principle that every workforce member has the right to work in surroundings that are free from all forms of unlawful discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, veteran, military status, religion, age, creed, national origin, sexual identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, genetic information, or any other basis prohibited by local, state, or federal law. We believe diversity makes us stronger, so we are dedicated to shaping an inclusive workforce, learning from each other, and creating equal opportunities for advancement.

This might include but is not limited to reaching out to external stakeholders such as the primary care provider and requesting assistance with the development of the plan of care. The purpose would be to overcome any identified barriers to care with the goal being to achieve a successful outcome for the patient. Additionally, the case manager should be verifying benefits and securing authorizations from the payer as indicated and documentation should include facilitation of necessary community resources as needed.
Lastly, advocacy is an important aspect in the case manager's role as he/she must take into consideration the patient's ability to safely maintain themselves in the community or when the patient's capacity is in question. The case manager needs to ensure the patient or healthcare proxy has the ability to fully understand the options of care being presented so an informed decision can be made. Also, this could include acting as a mediator between physicians/consultants and families when conflict arises or a change in status occurs that may put up road blocks to a successful transition to the next phase of care.
* **Data Collection:** Case Manager will participate in the collection of information regarding quality improvement activities, risk management issues and reporting this information through appropriate committee structure.

**About the Role**


As an RN Healthcare Advocate for Solace, you will work with Medicare patients throughout their healthcare journey.  

  

In this role, you will navigate patients through difficult and complex health concerns to help them achieve their health and wellness goals while addressing Social Determinants of Health (SDOH).

 **About Solace**


By harnessing the power of human connection through technology, Solace is transforming healthcare in the U.S.

By helping people work with professional health advocates, Solace serves as an integral, personal support layer for health issues in a way that the health system can’t. Using proprietary technology to match patients with experienced advocates, Solace cuts through the red tape of healthcare and helps individuals and families make informed decisions that result in better outcomes.

  

Solace is a Series B startup founded in 2022 and backed by Inspired Capital, Craft Ventures, Torch Capital, Menlo Ventures and Signalfire. We have a lean, fully\\-remote U.S. team distributed coast\\-to\\-coast.

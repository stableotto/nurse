COVID\\-19 Vaccination
Adventist HealthCare strongly recommends all applicants to be fully vaccinated for COVID\\-19 before commencing employment. Applicants may be required to furnish proof of vaccination.
Tobacco and Drug Statement
Tobacco use is a well\\-recognized preventable cause of death in the United States and an important public health issue. In order to promote and maintain a healthy work environment, Adventist HealthCare will not hire applicants for employment who either state that they are nicotine users or who test positive for nicotine and drug use.  

While some jurisdictions, including Maryland, permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes, marijuana continues to be classified as an illegal drug under the federal Controlled Substances Act. As a result, medical marijuana use will not be accepted as a valid explanation for a positive drug test result.  

Adventist HealthCare will withdraw offers of employment to applicants who test positive for Cotinine (nicotine) and marijuana. Those testing positive are given the opportunity to re\\-apply in 90 days, if they can truthfully attest that they have not used any nicotine products in the past ninety (90\\) days and successfully pass follow\\-up testing. (""Nicotine products"" include, but are not limited to: cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, e\\-cigarettes, vaping products, hookah, and nicotine replacement products (e.g., nicotine gum, nicotine patches, nicotine lozenges, etc.).
Equal Employment Opportunity  

Adventist HealthCare is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. We are committed to attracting, engaging, and developing the best people to cultivate our mission\\-centric culture. Our goal is to have a welcoming, equitable, and safe place to work and grow for all employees, no matter their background.

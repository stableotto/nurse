There is a wide variety of clinical trial patients and collaboration with the clinical research nurses to infuse study drugs. The unit is designed to provide a supportive environment for patients undergoing transplantation, from pre\\-transplant evaluation to post\\-transplant recovery and long\\-term follow\\-up.

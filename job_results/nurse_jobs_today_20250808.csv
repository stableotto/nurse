Complexity of duties


The RN role requires flexibility and the ability to lead team members who possess a variety of personalities. The RN role necessitates the incumbent to always maintain a high level of integrity, poise, and control. The nurse provides a full range of comprehensive nursing care that includes assessing patient needs, development of a plan of care, administration of medications and therapeutic measures, operation of specialized medical equipment, evaluation of the plan of care to ensure that the physical and psychosocial needs of the patient are met and counseling and teaching of patient and families. The nurse must recognize and respond appropriately to patient conditions that deviate from normal and identify, analyze, and report on causative factors and reactions. Guidelines consist of professional standards of practice as determined by the nurse practice act, nursing and medical policy and procedures, standing orders, and hospital and agency policies. Complies also with federal, state, accrediting, and local regulations. These guidelines are not always specifically applicable to the individual patient or situation, and independent judgment is required in selecting the most appropriate guideline and applying the intent of the guideline to the specific situation at hand. The nurse receives assistance from the nurse manager with difficult or unusual problems.

  

Supervision received


The nurse independently plans, schedules, and provides nursing care in coordination with the medical care plan and attempts to solve problems only within established procedures. This is done under the supervision of the nurse manager. The work is evaluated for technical soundness and adherence to professional standards.

  

Responsibility for accuracy


The incumbent has a positive effect on the recovery of the patient, is responsible for following policies and procedures, which serve as hospital guidelines, and prevents errors from occurring. Errors can have a negative patient outcome since the incumbent’s performance affects the health, recovery, and rehabilitation of patients, and the quality of care provided. Evaluations and observations are used to modify and develop clinically appropriate treatment plans. Work can be verified or checked by the immediate supervisor, other health care providers, or systems checks, but usually the responsibility for accuracy relies solely on the incumbent.

  

Contact with others


Contacts are with patients, families, hospital personnel, and community agencies. Contacts with patients, families, and hospital personnel are to exchange, provide, and obtain information concerning the patient’s physical and psychosocial health care problems and needs. The nurse uses teaching and counseling methods to influence and motivate patient and family behavior. Contacts with other health care or related disciplines within the hospital are for the purpose of collaboration and consultation. Tact, courtesy, and professional conduct are required to maintain positive working relationships. Utmost sensitivity and confidentiality is required when dealing with patients and families.

  

Confidential data


The incumbent has access to highly confidential patient medical and personal information. The Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that the incumbent shall maintain complete confidentiality of all administrative, medical, and all other pertinent information that comes to his/her attention or knowledge. The act carries both civil and criminal penalties for unlawful disclosure of records. Violations of such confidentiality shall be cause for adverse action.

  

Mental/visual/physical environment


Work in the various services within the nursing department is mostly sedentary, yet requires walking, standing, bending, pushing, and lifting in helping patients to and from beds, wheelchairs, and stretchers. These same activities are required in moving equipment and medical supplies. Will be subject to frequent interruptions requiring varied responses, which can cause distractions; therefore, the incumbent must possess the ability to differentiate and prioritize many tasks at once. May occasionally move more than 15 pounds.

  

Work environment


Must be flexible in working hours. Work is performed in the clinic setting, which is responsible for treating patients with a wide variety of medical problems. Incumbents may be exposed to communicable diseases. Incumbent is required to comply with employee health program guidelines, including current immunization status of identified communicable diseases, and safety precautions are sometimes necessary, such as use of personal protective equipment as required by hospital policy. The work environment involves moderate risks of exposure to infectious disease, radiation, electrical hazards, irritant chemicals, and explosive gases.

  

Customer service


Consistently demonstrates superior customer service skills to patients/customers by demonstrating characteristics that align with CIHA’s guiding principles and core values. Ensure excellent customer service is provided to all patients/customers by seeking out opportunities to be of service.","","https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Cherokee-Indian-Hospital-Authority","https://d2q79iu7y748jz.cloudfront.net/s/_squarelogo/256x256/a4175a4f253bb51874b8d0415fbe58b1","https://cherokeehospital.org","1 Hospital Rd.

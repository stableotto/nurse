The Flight Nurse extends the healing ministry of Jesus Christ by caring for critically ill and injured persons in the air medical environment. Practice is carried out with a high degree of independence in challenging out\\-of\\-hospital environments and at regional health care facilities. The position also has significant responsibility for public relations and involves interacting with a wide range of healthcare and public safety professionals in stressful situations. The position also requires subject matter management skills and independent work on projects to support Flight For Life operations. This position coordinates transport operations / clinical care with the Flight Paramedic and Pilot crew members in conjunction with policies and procedures that have been established by Flight For Life Administration, the Flight For Life Medical Director, and Flight For Life’s contracted aviation services (FAA Part 135\\) operator.


 PHYSICAL, SENSORY, ENVIRONMENTAL:


Work is active and requires mobility to get in/out of aircraft and ground ambulances, frequent lifting and carrying up to 100 pounds, twisting and bending to perform patient care, finger and hand dexterity to adequately handle/manipulate equipment and to perform procedures/treatments, adequate hearing and visual acuity to adequately detect changes in patient’s condition and perform physical assessments.


 Requires the ability to be able to sit in aircraft seats with safety belts secured and have physical dexterity to perform procedures from this position (without modification of the FAA approved interior of the aircraft).


 Position involves work in the in\\-flight environment that is subject to aviation conditions and meteorological phenomenon that may have untoward physiologic side effects (i.e., motion sickness, vertigo, fatigue, temperature extremes)


 Requires the emotional stability to function effectively in unpredictable situations.


 Requires full and complete adherence to dress code and protective gear policies designed to mitigate transport environment related hazards to include (but not limited to): wearing long\\-sleeve flame resistant uniforms, gloves, boots, and flight helmets.


 Blood\\-Borne Pathogen Category I: associates who are expected to have exposure to blood\\-borne pathogens during the performance of their job.


 JOB DIMENSIONS:


 The Flight Nurse will consistently respond to transport requests safely and urgently, working to reach the patient/customers and complete transport to definitive care in a safe and timely manner. Flight For Life associates will maintain operational readiness by completing transports efficiently, rapidly reconstitute after transports, and minimizing out of service time.


 The Flight Nurse will consistently render the highest quality patient care in a professional, expedient, and safe manner, under little or no supervision. This associate uses excellent communication skills to plan and implement patient care in collaboration with other health care agencies. The Flight Nurse will diligently document patient care in a thorough and accurate manner that complies with departmental policy. All Flight For Life associates who have direct or indirect access to patient health information must treat that information with the strictest confidence.


 The Flight Nurse is mindful of safety throughout the transport, and maintains a thorough working knowledge of aviation safety, radio communications, and emergency procedures. Flight For Life clinical associates will assist the Pilot in Command (PIC) as trained/directed, and are expected to maintain competence in VFR, IFR, and NVG operations as specified by the FAA Part 135 operator. The associate will be prepared to respond to in\\-flight emergencies or incidents by assisting the PIC as trained, and will be prepared to survive in an austere environment until help arrives while rendering aid to patients and/or crewmembers as needed.


 The Flight Nurse will maintain a state of readiness to immediately respond to transport requests. This associate will participate in daily shift duties such as continuing education, training exercises, cleaning/decontaminating the aircraft/base, inventory of supplies and equipment, CQI/peer review, patient follow\\-ups, and obtaining appropriate rest as needed for extended shifts. Flight For Life associates promote individual professional growth and development through self\\-directed learning to improve their professional skills, participating in subject matter management roles (SMMR), and by serving as a mentor/resource to less experienced staff.


 The Flight Nurse will complete all orientation requirements, and progress through the clinical ladder levels. This associate will participate in continuing education, simulation labs, and maintain competency in procedures as required for Flight For Life and accrediting bodies. This position requires the associate to achieve and maintain multiple certifications and credentials, actively participate continuous quality improvement (CQI) processes.

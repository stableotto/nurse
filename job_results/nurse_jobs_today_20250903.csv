This role is ideal for a motivated, outcomes\\-driven professional who thrives in fast\\-paced environments and wants the flexibility, creativity, and autonomy to improve how patient discharges are handled.


Unlike traditional hospital case management, this role gives you the chance to innovate, collaborate, and directly impact patients and families during critical transitions of care.

* Build and refine scalable workflows and processes that increase efficiency and outcomes.  

Partner with SilverStay leadership and hospital teams to track key metrics (LOS, readmission rates, discharge success) and continuously improve results.
* Leverage technology and data\\-driven insights to transform how complex cases are managed.

### **Who You Are**

* Licensed RN, LMSW, or LCSW
* Experienced in case management, discharge planning, or transitional care.
* Skilled at navigating post\\-acute settings (SNF, LTACH, rehab, home health).
* A patient and family\\-centered communicator with empathy, professionalism, and persistence.
* Ambitious and entrepreneurial — eager to grow, innovate, and take ownership of your work.
* Thrives in high\\-responsibility, high\\-ambiguity environments where adaptability and creativity are key.
* Tech\\-savvy and excited about the role of innovation in healthcare.

### **Why Join SilverStay**

* **Autonomy \\& flexibility:** This isn’t a rigid 7\\-to\\-7 hospital shift. You’ll have the freedom to manage your time and approach, as long as you deliver results.
* **High expectations \\+ high support:** We set ambitious goals, but we also make sure our team has the tools and backup to achieve them.
* **Growth potential:** No cap to your impact, no cap to your salary. As SilverStay grows, so can you.
* **Values\\-driven:** Empathy. Creativity. Collaboration. Ethical Conduct. And always, *wowing* patients and clients.
* **We take care of our people:** When you need help, you’ll get an answer right away. We prioritize responsiveness, support, and being genuinely good colleagues.

### **Compensation \\& Benefits**

* **Competitive Salary:** $70,000 \\- $85,000, commensurate with experience and potential impact.
* **Performance\\-Bonus:** Bonus structure that can add 10% to 40% of base salary, tied directly to outcomes and results.
* **Health \\& Wellness:** Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage \\- including spouse and family.
* **Retirement Planning:** 401(k) with employer contribution.

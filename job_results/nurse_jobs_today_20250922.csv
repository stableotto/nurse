Making family care possible. At Abby Care, we are tackling one of the most important and unsolved challenges of our time: family caregiving.  

  

Over 50 million Americans are family caregivers for loved ones without pay, tools, or support. Our mission is clear and ambitious: to train and employ family caregivers so they can get paid for the care they already provide at home.  

  

Abby Care is building a tech\\-powered, family\\-first care platform to efficiently deliver care, improve health outcomes, and provide the best\\-in\\-class experience nationwide.  

  

We are rapidly expanding our mission and looking for passionate team members to join. Abby Care has partnered with leading insurance plans, healthcare providers, and community organizations. We're supported by top, mission\\-driven VCs to empower families throughout the country.

The RN Case Manager at Abby Care is responsible for overseeing the comprehensive care and coordination of services for patients within their caseload. This role requires a nurse with excellent organizational skills, strong communication abilities, and a dedication to providing high\\-quality patient care.

* **Quality Assurance:**
* + Achieve caregiver satisfaction by providing high\\-quality, compassionate care and support.
	+ Monitor and work to improve patient readmission rates.
	+ Ensure extended visits remain within acceptable ranges and administrative tasks (e.g., mileage reimbursements) are completed thoroughly.

### **The Requirements:**


* An Associate's Degree or A Baccalaureate School of Nursing Degree.

Millions of families are waiting for care, and they cannot wait, therefore this is not your typical 9 to 5 job. We match their urgency with our own, delivering exceptional care without compromise. Here, speed and excellence go hand in hand**.**
* **Relentlessly Resourceful**  

As an ambitious startup, we adapt quickly and make the most of limited time and resources. We solve challenges with creativity to deliver results without unnecessary complexity.

We take our mission seriously while never losing sight of the people behind the work. Respect, kindness, memes, and coffee make us stronger as a team and better for the families we serve.


* **Driven to Redefine What's Possible**  

We are here to make healthcare better, which means asking hard questions, challenging outdated systems, and finding smarter, more compassionate ways to deliver care.

And if you could collaborate with the world’s brightest scientists, in a bench\\-to\\-bedside environment that puts you on the leading edge of clinical breakthroughs for children with cancer, sickle cell, and other life\\-threatening diseases. It’s possible at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

St. Jude is looking for an energetic, initiative\\-taking nurse to develop this CNS position in our unique outpatient department.

The **Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS)** is an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) with advanced education and training in a specialized area of nursing. The CNS integrates care across the continuum and through three spheres of impact: direct patient care, nurses/nursing personnel and organizations/systems. The three spheres are overlapping and interrelated, but each sphere has a distinct focus. In each of the spheres of impact the primary goal of the CNS is to support the delivery of high quality, evidenced\\-based care which achieves optimal patient, nurse and organizational outcomes. The CNS identifies where the gaps are in health care delivery, helps design and implement interventions, and assesses and evaluates the interventions to improve overall health care delivery. CNSs provide expertise and support to nurses caring for patients and help drive practice changes throughout the organization. Serving as a mentor and consultant to nurses, the CNS advances the art and science of nursing through applying new knowledge and influencing decisions at the organizational level to remove barriers to care. The CNS partners with RNs, leaders, health care providers, quality and education partners and staff to achieve these outcomes.

We have an immediate opening for a Functional Medicine Practitioner. For the right candidate, this is a life\\-changing career opportunity.  

  

Our clinic sees dozens of Functional Medicine new patients each month. These are patients that show up presenting Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, metabolic syndrome, Crohn’s, blood sugar problems, IBS, inflammation, Lupus (and other auto\\-immune issues), endocrine issues, and more. The complexity of these cases ranges from relatively low, to highly complex. We are looking for a Functional Medicine professional to assist us in our mission to effectively address these problems at the root cause, and get real and lasting results for our patients.  

  

WHO WE ARE  

  

We are a group of professionals that have scaled our Chiropractic clinics to three locations, seeing hundreds of new patients a month while creating unforgettable patient experiences and life\\-changing healthcare outcomes for the patients we serve.  

  

We are a mission\\-centered Health Care group committed to changing lives by performing great work for the people who trust us to come through for them while creating some of the most financially rewarding career opportunities for the Chiropractic industry, while practicing in beautiful, state of the art clinics and having marketing done for them in a way that allows them to operate as true doctors, focused on patient care and patient outcomes.  

  

WHO YOU ARE  

  

The right candidate for this position will be someone with real\\-world experience with Functional Medicine. This is not an “entry level” position; this is for someone who understands Functional Medicine at a deep level, and understands the process from start to finish, including:  

  

Ordering the correct blood test diagnostics  

Understanding and interpreting those diagnostics for patients  

Granular knowledge of blood chemistry, and how various inputs (such as nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and food) impact and change blood chemistry  

How gut permeability impacts the immune system, and how by addressing a gut permeability problem, immune, endocrine, and inflammatory issues in the body can be healed and/or reversed  

A solid understanding of how different systems of the body interact with each other to create dysfunction in patients.  

An understanding of the root causes of heart disease, metabolic conditions, weight management problems, autoimmune disease, endocrine and inflammatory issues.  

A knowledge of the connections and interactions of gut health with the cardiovascular system, brain, reproductive organs and immune system.  

From a credentialing perspective, we believe a Naturopath, Nurse NP, RN, Doctor of Chiropractic, Nutritionist, DO, MD, or other provider can effectively fulfill the obligations of the role. We do not have a strong opinion as to the educational background of the right person to fulfill this role; what we DO care about as that the person is both passionate about Functional Medicine, has the appropriate healthcare philosophy to succeed in the role, and brings a wealth of Functional Medicine knowledge to bear in serving our patients.  

  

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR  

  

We are looking for a provider to service our Functional Medicine patients. The right person will need to bring expertise in Functional Medicine to the position, while at the same time learning the specifics of our system, and how we get results for patients. You will be expected to learn quickly, take ownership for the patient outcomes you drive, and have a high level of professional communication in reporting results, as well as troubleshooting issues with patients.  

  

You will need to have familiarity with various blood testing portals, and be able to have enough technical skills to handle email attachments, PDF’s, and navigate our EMR to load and review patient information.  

  

You will need to be able to communicate effectively and professionally \\- meaning, complete sentences that are grammatically correct, typing at more than 45 words per minute, and organizing emails in a way that ensures complete and timely responses for patients.  

  

You will need to bring real\\-world experience in getting Functional Medicine results for patients. We are not interested in a candidate who has “learned a lot” but never practiced with a patient. This is not an academic position, but a real\\-world position that is boots\\-on\\-the\\-ground, serving people, and changing their lives through our 6R Functional Medicine process.  

  

NEXT STEPS  

  

If you are interested in this position, please apply, including an updated resume/CV, as well as an explanation of why you believe you’d be a good fit for this position.

Backed by Precursor Ventures and 1843 Capital, we're transforming how migraine is treated through an innovative combination of telemedicine, AI\\-enabled monitoring, and personalized care plans. Our early results are exceptional—our initial patient cohort is seeing a 70% improvement rate with days impacted by headache reduced by half.

**The Opportunity**
-------------------


We’re looking for a **Founding RN** to deliver exceptional patient care while shaping the foundation of our nursing practice. This is a hybrid role: 75% patient\\-facing and 25% building clinical processes and workflows for nursing and MA support. You’ll be the first RN at Haven, playing a critical role in how we deliver care, educate patients, and scale our nursing model as we exponentially increase our patients under management.

### **You’ll Help Us**

* Deliver outstanding patient care through direct communication, triage, and education.
* Serve as the primary clinical touchpoint for **Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM)**, ensuring patients find value in daily tracking and engagement.
* Build, own, and refine clinical protocols and workflows for nursing, including how MAs interface with nursing.
* Mentor and train future RNs and MAs, establishing a culture of clinical excellence and patient\\-centered care.
* Partner closely with the CMO to align nursing practice with Haven’s care model.
* Act as a culture\\-carrier for the patient experience, setting the tone for compassionate, responsive, and evidence\\-based care.
* **Lead care coordination,** finalize provider orders; manage referrals, imaging, labs, and medication refills.
* Participate in **Quality Control by** performing chart audits, ensuring efficiency of clinic workflows, tracking delays in imaging, prior authorizations, and referrals.

**What We’re Looking For**
--------------------------

* **Active California or Texas RN license** (BSN or higher preferred). Compact license preferred
* 4\\+ years of clinical nursing experience in inpatient or outpatient specialty medicine, or environments where you regularly executed standing orders
* Ideally, you have worked in headache medicine or neurology.
* Experience in digital health or startup environments strongly preferred, or demonstrated adaptability in fast\\-scaling clinical settings.
* Excellent project management skills
* Ability to design and implement scalable nursing workflows, not just follow them.
* Strong communication skills and empathy—comfortable engaging directly with patients over telehealth and SMS\\-based programs.
* Excitement for ambiguity and willingness to roll up sleeves in an early\\-stage, growing team.

**You’re a Strong Fit If You**
------------------------------

* Love delivering care, but also want to shape how care is delivered at scale.
* Thrive in environments where you’re both a **hands\\-on clinician** and a **builder of systems**.
* Are motivated by solving patient problems in real time and improving the processes behind the scenes.
* Want to be part of a mission\\-driven team rethinking what specialty care looks like.

**Our Culture \\& Benefits**
---------------------------


At Haven, we offer a unique opportunity to work directly with experienced founders and clinical leaders who have built and scaled successful healthcare companies. You’ll receive meaningful equity in a venture\\-backed company tackling a massive problem, along with comprehensive healthcare benefits. Our hybrid work environment, with 2 days per week in our San Francisco office, provides flexibility while maintaining strong team collaboration.

**Diversity \\& Inclusion**
--------------------------


Diversity is built into our DNA with a founding team representing POC, female, disabled, and LGBTQ\\+ founders. We strongly encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply—many successful candidates may not meet every requirement. Studies show that underrepresented candidates often only apply when meeting 100% of qualifications; we'd love to hear from you even if you don’t check every box.


Haven Headache \\& Migraine Center is proud to be an equal\\-opportunity employer. All aspects of employment, including hiring, promotion, discipline, and termination are based solely on merit, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of any legally protected status.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

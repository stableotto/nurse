Our overall mission is to Inspire Hope, Restore Peace of Mind and Heal Lives.

**Why We’re Here**


The care and compassion in this community is inspired by the life of a sweet boy who lived, loved, and was loved by many, but is no longer here to see the sun rise again. Addiction and mental illness account for the lives of so many, but with the right family system of support, there is much hope for a beautiful life.


Like so many others, Ethan had his share of struggles: family hardship, difficulty finding his place in this world, and trouble realizing his life’s dreams and aspirations. The confluence of his life circumstances led him to depression and addiction, which ultimately took his life at the tender age of twenty\\-two. Ethan Crossing Recovery seeks to honor his life by providing for others that which he did not have, a family system that understands, supports, and is there for the lifelong journey of sustainable recovery.


Ethan’s Crossing of Springfield is an 80 bed residential detox facility located in Springfield, Ohio. We are here to help get people on the road to recovery. Ethan Crossing combines innovative therapy with passionate care to provide comprehensive treatment for addiction and mental health disorders. We believe that everyone deserves a shot at recovery

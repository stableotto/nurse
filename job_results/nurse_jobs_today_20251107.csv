**What is important to know?**


We are growing and excited to be able to support our clients’ nursing staffs in the field who need time to focus on work\\-life balance, as well, while being able to trust that we are there to support them and their patients during nights and weekends!

* Patient care is \\#1\\. We do not have call quotas. We employ the best nurses to provide the best care.
* When our patients or their families reach our triage line, they immediately speak directly with a nurse.
* We do not have PRN positions.
* We are super busy. If you like fast\\-paced roles, keep reading…
* Any nurse may pick up additional shifts, if shifts are available for the clients’ they are trained to support.
* We will provide you with a laptop and headset.
* Nurses are required to provide their own high\\-speed internet (only fiberoptic or coaxial cable internet is compatible with our remote call center technology).

It depends on the pace of the calls received during that shift and the pace of your ability to quickly navigate technology and type.

**Sound exciting to you?**


Then… put those days on the floor and that commute or hours on the road between patients’ homes behind you! Our nurses enjoy working from their own home office; no more purchasing scrubs, expensive takeout, and the large gas bill along with extra wear\\-and\\-tear on your vehicle.

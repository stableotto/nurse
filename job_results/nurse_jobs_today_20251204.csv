We are proud to celebrate Atrium Health Lincoln on achieving their Magnet Recognition with Distinction from the American Nurses Credentialing Center along with being honored with 14 exemplars. This award winning, 101\\-bed hospital, was designed with the community in mind. The facility opened in 2010, replacing a family farm. History from this farm can be seen and found on the campus today. 300,000 reclaimed bricks from a local mill, Belding\\-Hausman Mill, were placed into the exterior of the hospital and represent the dedication to the community they serve. The campus also has a 1\\.2\\-mile public walking trail that encircles the campus, winding past ponds and through natural wooded areas left intact on the land. Two medical office buildings that house many Provider offices and offer medical services that serve the community can also be found on Atrium Health Lincoln's campus.

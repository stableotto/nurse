Juno leverages collective bargaining power to secure better student loan rates for graduate students. With 230,000\\+ members and over $1B in negotiated loan volume, we've proven that group buying works. We are the most popular way to pay for the world’s top MBA programs and are now expanding to serve many more graduate students at a critical moment in higher education.


### **The Problem**



Federal lending reforms are creating an unprecedented market shift. Starting July 2026, new caps on federal graduate loans (including the elimination of Grad PLUS) will leave millions of students with significant funding gaps. Students will increasingly need transparent, competitive private options—exactly what Juno negotiates. ￼


### **Your mission**



We're seeking a manager to own the growth targets for our Nursing vertical. Your efforts will ensure every future Nursing student gets fair, transparent financing options amid new federal caps.



You'll build the playbook for reaching 100k\\+ Nursing students each year across hundreds of Nursing programs, converting waitlist demand to funded loans, and establishing Juno as the go\\-to resource for student financing. In success, this is a team\\-building role \\- start by doing the work yourself, prove the model, then build and lead the team you need to scale.


### **What you’ll do**


* **Own the Nursing** **GTM:** Build and execute GTM strategy, hit growth targets, and drive Juno member growth
* **Scale distribution through partnerships:**
* + Negotiate national deals with key organizations that can help reach our target market
	+ Activate campus\\-based chapters with educational resources
	+ Build relationships with financial aid offices at target schools
	+ Partner with pre\\-Nursing clubs at undergraduate programs
* **Build a campus ambassador network:** Recruit, train, and manage high\\-performing Nursing students across target programs with clear KPIs and incentives
* **Drive cross\\-functional initiatives:** Partner with product on feature development, lender relations on competitive rates, and compliance on messaging
* **Manage operations and analytics:** Forecast pipeline, track cohort performance, optimize CAC/LTV, and manage budget allocation
* Own **waitlist growth loan origination**: landing pages, A/B tests, content, webinars, email/SMS, and event cycles aligned to application, admissions, and financial aid timelines

### **What We Offer**



**Compensation**: Competitive base salary \\+ performance bonus with significant upside potential



**Benefits**: Comprehensive health, dental, vision, and retirement matching


### **What We’re Looking For**


* **Background**: Typically **2–4\\+ years** or an **outlier track record** (e.g., you scaled a campus network, ran national org programming, built a zero‑to‑one motion).
* + Preference for experience in professional services, management consulting, investment banking, or high\\-growth startups
	+ Preference for an Owner‑operator who has **owned a number** in growth/BD/marketplaces/fintech/edtech or campus‑scale programs.
* **Exceptional writing \\& communication**: you can craft compliant, persuasive copy for students, deans, and national orgs.
* **Bias to action**: ship experiments frequently; instrument attribution; close loops with lender relations \\& compliance.
* **Tenacity**: we work as hard as it takes to achieve our targets.

### **The X\\-Factor**


* **You lived it:** Pre\\-Nursing/Nursing experience, or other connections to Nursing education are an advantage (but not required)
* **You're hungry:** Ready to own outcomes, not just make recommendations
* **You're scrappy:** Will do whatever it takes to win


Compensation: $100k–$200k, including performance upside tied to growth milestones.


### **Why Join Juno?**


**The Opportunity**



 Real Impact: Help hundreds of thousands of students get access to the lowest rates on the market



 Market Timing: Federal aid changes create massive tailwind for growth

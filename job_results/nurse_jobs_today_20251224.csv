This opportunity places you at the forefront of cancer care, where your clinical expertise, compassion, and patient education illuminate the treatment path for individuals and families navigating challenging diagnoses. You’ll join a seasoned oncology team that values precision, collaboration, and ongoing learning. Your impact will stretch from the infusion suite to the patient’s home, supporting comfort, dignity, and informed decision\\-making. And when you’re off the unit, you’ll discover California’s natural charm—sunlit valleys, forested trails, and cultural vibrancy—creating a balanced rhythm between professional purpose and personal renewal. The assignment begins on December 23, 2025, and runs for a duration measured in weeks, with opportunities to extend based on needs and performance.  

  

Chico offers a welcoming, community\\-focused environment with access to a high\\-caliber medical system and educational resources. Working here means you’ll be immersed in a city known for its student vitality, outdoor recreation, and a relaxed, family\\-friendly atmosphere. The location benefits extend beyond patient care: you’ll have the chance to broaden your horizons through flexible cross\\-site experiences within California and across the United States, should you seek exposure to diverse patient populations and practice settings. Our program emphasizes smooth onboarding, dependable schedules, and a robust support network so you can settle into travel nursing with confidence. You’ll enjoy a stable 36 guaranteed hours per week and a weekly pay range of $1,763 to $1,789, with housing assistance provided to ease relocation. The pathway to extension is clear, offering continuity with the same account or the opportunity to pursue new sites that align with your oncology specialization and professional goals. This role is built for nurses who value balance, purposeful work, and the chance to deepen clinical expertise in a thriving regional hub.  

  

As an Oncology RN, your day\\-to\\-day responsibilities will center on comprehensive cancer care. You’ll conduct thorough initial assessments, administer and monitor chemotherapy and supportive infusions, manage treatment\\-related side effects, and provide meticulous symptom control and patient education. You’ll collaborate with physicians, pharmacists, social workers, and palliative care teams to coordinate care across the continuum, participate in rounds and tumor boards, and contribute to evidence\\-based protocols that enhance safety and outcomes. The position supports professional growth within the oncology specialty through mentorship, continuing education opportunities, and pathways toward advanced practice.

Location benefits: Hilo offers a tropical climate, a tight\\-knit community, and direct access to volcanic coastline and world\\-class snorkeling, farms, and local culture. Working here gives you the chance to immerse yourself in native Hawaiian culture, take short trips to neighboring islands, and enjoy a pace that blends professional purpose with relaxed island living.

Core responsibilities include rapid patient assessment, airway management, IV placement, medication administration, hemodynamic monitoring, documentation, and collaboration with physicians, techs, and unit secretaries to maintain smooth throughput. You’ll participate in debriefings, quality improvement initiatives, and continuing education that supports professional growth within emergency nursing. The position includes a competitive weekly pay range of $1,790 to $1,895, with additional incentives, a housing allowance or arranged lodging, and the potential for contract extensions based on performance and unit needs. While there are no guaranteed hours, you’ll have predictable, consistent scheduling options within the contract terms, and opportunities to extend your assignment if you choose. We provide 24/7 support as you travel with the company, including access to clinical leadership, travel coordination, and on\\-call assistance whenever you need it, ensuring you never navigate a challenging case alone. Orientation and credentialing support are part of the onboarding, helping you acclimate quickly to local protocols and patient populations.  

  

Company values: Our organization is dedicated to empowering clinicians—prioritizing safety, professional development, and a supportive, collaborative culture. We invest in your growth through mentorship, specialty training, leadership pathways, and access to a network of ER professionals across the country. You’ll work in settings that value your contributions, encourage questions, recognize effort, and reward clinical excellence, all while maintaining a focus on work\\-life balance and personal well\\-being.  

  

Call to action: If you’re ready to answer the call of urgent, compassionate care—from Hawaii’s shores to hospitals across the U.S.—apply today. Begin February 2, 2026, with a contract designed to challenge you, grow your skill set, and broaden your professional horizons. This is your chance to impact lives, advance in a supportive environment, and experience a travel nursing career that respects your expertise and your time.  

  

Note: Hours and pay rates are estimates and may vary. Final compensation packages and any guaranteed hours will be confirmed during the hiring process. Duration and extension opportunities are determined by hospital needs and performance. Start date is February 2, 2026, and the initial assignment will be for a number of weeks with the possibility of extension.**Privacy \\& Consent**

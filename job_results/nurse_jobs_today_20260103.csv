This travel assignment invites you to bring evidence‑based obstetric care to moms and babies while collaborating with a multidisciplinary team committed to safety, dignity, and celebrated outcomes. You’ll guide labor progress, monitor fetal well‑being, support comfort measures, assist with deliveries, and partner with physicians and midwives to provide seamless postpartum and newborn care. Your influence will extend beyond clinical excellence as you mentor teammates, educate families about lactation and newborn care, and elevate the standard of obstetric practice across diverse patient populations. While you pursue this meaningful work, you’ll also have the opportunity to experience Hawaii’s extraordinary everyday moments: turquoise waters, lush landscapes, and a cultural tapestry that welcomes discovery, balance, and renewal. The scenic beauty of the islands—from dramatic coastlines to cascading waterfalls and starlit skies—will accompany your professional journey and enrich your everyday life, creating a unique backdrop for growth and purpose.  

  

Located in Hilo, this role offers the appeal of a close‑knit community hospital environment that values culturally competent care, teamwork, and patient‑centered delivery. You’ll be immersed in obstetric care that emphasizes family engagement, safety, and continuous improvement, with the option to extend your assignments across additional U.S. locations depending on staffing needs.

As an L\\&D nurse, you’ll own a wide range of responsibilities designed to sharpen your clinical acumen and leadership skills. Core duties include assessing labor progress, conducting fetal surveillance, assisting with vaginal deliveries and cesarean births, and coordinating pain management with anesthesia. You’ll perform newborn assessments, facilitate breastfeeding initiation, and provide thorough postpartum education and discharge planning. Documentation and communication with the care team will be meticulous, ensuring safety nets are in place for both mother and infant. You’ll stay current with clinical guidelines, participate in rounds, and contribute to continuous improvement initiatives that advance obstetric care. This role supports your professional growth within the specialty through exposure to high‑quality obstetric care, opportunities to pursue additional certifications, and the potential for leadership or teaching roles with the broader travel program. The position also offers a competitive set of benefits designed to recognize your expertise, including a signing or completion bonus, housing assistance, and extension opportunities to continue building your career with continuity and purpose. You’ll receive robust support from a dedicated travel team and, crucially, 24/7 assistance while you’re on assignment, ensuring you have rapid access to resources for clinical questions, housing, transport, or personal needs during your travel.  

  

Our company values your contribution and is committed to empowering your career trajectory within a supportive work environment. You’ll find a culture that prioritizes professional development, mentorship, and a respectful, inclusive atmosphere where your clinical judgment is trusted and your growth is a shared goal. Whether you’re navigating complex obstetric cases, collaborating with a diverse care team, or pursuing additional credentials, you’ll have access to ongoing education, network opportunities, and structured pathways to advance. The emphasis is on sustaining work‑life balance, recognizing the demands of travel nursing, and providing a collaborative, patient‑centered framework that helps you deliver extraordinary care while advancing your own career.

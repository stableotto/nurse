Imagine being the first person to hold a patient's hand as they take their first pain\\-free step in years.

* You thrive in providing care that is straightforward in nature rather than solving for multiple complex medical comorbidities
* Meeting a variety of patients energizes you

What you will do in this role:

* Deliver high\\-quality, patient\\-centered care while managing evidence\\-based practices and continuous improvement initiatives
* Be an integral member of a dynamic interdisciplinary team – consisting of the provider(s), therapy, and more.
* Consistently apply the nursing process, critical thinking skills, scientific judgment, technical skills and leadership to independently deliver safe nursing care to patients

* Basic Life Support (BLS) Certification must be obtained within 30 days of employment start date
* Current Registered Nurse License in the State of Texas or Multi\\-State Compact License (Employees with RN Compact License are required to obtain Texas RN License within 90 days of hire date)
* Bachelor's Degree, Associate's Degree, or Registered Nurse Diploma
* A minimum of six months employment experience as a Registered Nurse in any setting (short or long\\-term acute care, home health, etc).


Note: We are able to train or upskill candidates without direct Orthopedic experience as part of a thorough, extended unit orientation

CVH opened in 1868 as the State’s public hospital for the treatment of persons with mental illness. Throughout its history, it has experienced the multitude of medical, social and political changes affecting such facilities. In 1995, the Governor and General Assembly through a statewide restructuring of services for persons with psychological and addiction disabilities called for a renewed commitment to specialized treatment at CVH by expanding community options for patients and staff while closing two other hospitals and consolidating inpatient services here. The hospital became the amalgamation of four formerly freestanding psychiatric hospitals, four freestanding substance use disorder treatment facilities, and one maximum security hospital. Then in 2010, the former Cedarcrest Regional Hospital (with 2 campuses – Cedar Ridge campus in Newington and Blue Hills campus in Hartford) consolidated services with CVH. On May 1, 2018, the Whiting Forensic Division of CVH separated, creating two separate hospitals; Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH) and Whiting Forensic Hospital (WFH). Today, CVH is comprised of 17 inpatient units over two campuses (Middletown and Hartford).  

  

**PLEASE NOTE:**
* + A comprehensive medical examination, including a drug screening, will be required of all applicants upon a conditional offer of employment.
	+ All state employees must adhere to Connecticut's Policy for a Drug Free Workplace.

***Clinical Nurse II \\- Progressive Care***
Under supervision, to apply the theoretical concepts of the nursing profession while providing routine direct patient care within the parameters of established nursing policies and procedures in controlled patient care situations required by the assigned clinical setting.**Distinguishing Characteristics**
The Clinical Nurse II classification is distinguished from the Clinical Nurse I classification in that the Clinical Nurse I is specifically an entry level classification for registered nurses with no or limited experience, whereas the Clinical Nurse II is a registered nurse (RN) with at least one year of recent RN experience in a nursing specialty.
The Clinical Nurse II classification is distinguished from the Clinical Nurse III classification in that the Clinical Nurse II works under supervision while performing specific patient care assignments, whereas the Clinical Nurse III is expected to have the knowledge and abilities to assume charge nurse responsibility.  

The Clinical Nurse classification series is distinguished from the Public Health Nurse classification series in that the Clinical Nurse classification series works directly with individual patients or a defined patient assignment, where patients are injured, ill, or in life\\-threatening situations requiring nursing interventions, whereas the Public Health Nurse works in clinics, homes, and community settings caring for the health of the population to prevent disease and improve population health.  

The Clinical Nurse classification series differs from the Psychiatric Nurse classification series in that the Psychiatric Nurse classification series works in mental health hospitals and clinics providing psychiatric and nursing interventions. **COVID\\-19 Risk Tier – High Risk** **Progressive Care Units include:**

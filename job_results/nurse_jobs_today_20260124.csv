**Description:**  

Registered Nurse Case Manager (PACE)
  
Practice real nursing. Build real relationships. Go home on time.
  
  

At Eddy SeniorCare PACE, our nurses do what they trained to do: assess, problem‑solve, and care for older adults in a way that keeps them safe, independent, and in their own homes.
  
  

If you’re an RN who wants time with patients/participants, clinical autonomy, and a collaborative medical team, this role was built for you.
  
What Makes This RN Role Different
  
True clinical nursing, not task nursing
  
  

* Perform comprehensive in‑home and center‑based assessments
* Manage acute changes, post‑hospital and post‑ER follow‑ups
* Conduct wound assessments, medication management, vaccinations, and injections


Community‑based care with real impact
  
  

* Care for a consistent panel of enrolled participants
* Help seniors safely age in place — preventing ER visits and hospitalizations
* Complete home visits that allow you to see the whole picture, not just the chart


Advanced medication management
  
  

* Coordinate, reconcile, set up, educate, and adjust medications in the home
* Work hands‑on with medisets, dispensing units, and pharmacy coordination
* Deliver practical education that actually improves adherence and outcomes


Interdisciplinary team model
  
  

* Collaborate closely with PACE physicians, clinic staff, social work, rehab, and home care
* Participate in plan‑of‑care meetings where your nursing judgment truly matters
* Direct communication with providers — no layers of red tape
* Autonomy, support, and professional growth
* Make independent nursing decisions while backed by a strong clinical leadership team
* Grow skills in geriatric nursing, care coordination, and complex chronic care


Predictable schedule, meaningful work
  
  

* Daytime hours, community‑focused care
* Spend your time nursing — not chasing productivity metrics or call‑lights


Who Thrives in This Role
  
  

* RNs who love thinking clinically and working independently
* Nurses drawn to geriatric, home‑based, or community health
* Professionals who value relationships, teamwork, and quality care over volume


Minimum Requirements
  
  

* Active NYS RN license
* At least 1 year of RN experience (home care, community health, geriatrics, or case management a plus)
* Comfort working independently in homes and collaborating across disciplines


Why Eddy SeniorCare PACE?
  
  

PACE nursing allows you to care for participants the way healthcare should work — with time, resources, and teamwork focused on prevention, dignity, and quality of life.
  
If you’re ready for a role where your judgment is trusted and your work truly matters, we’d love to meet you.

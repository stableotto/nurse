**Denton, TX**


We are supporting a long\\-term contract need for Licensed Vocational Nurses at a large, state\\-supported residential care setting in the Denton area. This environment serves adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities who may also have complex medical, mental health or behavioral health needs.

* 2:00 PM – 10:00 PM
* 10:00 PM – 6:00 AM

### **What You Will Be Doing**

* Provide direct nursing care to residents in a residential care setting
* Administer medications and treatments and provide medication education
* Complete accurate clinical documentation
* Perform computer data entry with full training provided
* Follow established policies and procedures to meet regulatory and accreditation standards including ICF\\-IDD and HHSC guidelines

### **What You Must Have**

* Active Texas LVN license
* Minimum of 2 years of LVN experience
* Ability to meet HHSC immunization requirements
* Willingness to complete required drug screening and fingerprinting
* Ability to complete all facility and HHSC\\-mandated training

### **Why This Role Appeals to LVNs**

* Structured environment with clear workflows and support
* Meaningful patient relationships and continuity of care

* Suitable for LVNs with experience in long\\-term care, behavioral health, corrections, residential care or med\\-surg backgrounds


If you are open to a contract assignment that offers stability, purpose and a supportive clinical setting, this role is worth a conversation.

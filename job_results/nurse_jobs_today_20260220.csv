All case manager activities will be client\\-centric, performed in a proactive manner, require on\\-going assessment of needs, evaluation of resources, knowledge of associated costs and education as indicated. The case manager is responsible for presenting options in an unbiased fashion to all involved parties and in compliance with HIPAA. Empowerment of the patient or healthcare proxy is expected and maintained so an informed decision regarding continued care needs can be made. Advocacy and education are at the heart of all activities with the basic goal focused on providing best clinical outcomes possible for the patient through evidenced based practice.

* ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS

Assessment and evaluation of the patient needs will be conducted by reviewing current and prior functioning, psycho\\-social dynamics, and identification of support system. The discharge plan is developed in collaboration with the multi\\-disciplinary team which may include the payer and will include active input from the patient and/or family. Identification of barriers must be considered in order to facilitate a smooth and successful transition to the next level of care. The case manager will address issues with prior plan of care, specifically with regards to readmissions.

Documentation of the case manager's activities and discussions should be outlined in the patient's medical record. This might include but is not limited to reaching out to external stakeholders such as the primary care provider and requesting assistance with the development of the plan of care. The purpose would be to overcome any identified barriers to care with the goal being to achieve a successful outcome for the patient. Additionally, the case manager should be verifying benefits and securing authorizations from the payer as indicated and documentation should include facilitation of necessary community resources as needed.
Lastly, advocacy is an important aspect in the case manager's role as he/she must take into consideration the patient's ability to safely maintain themselves in the community or when the patient's capacity is in question. The case manager needs to ensure the patient or healthcare proxy has the ability to fully understand the options of care being presented so an informed decision can be made. Also, this could include acting as a mediator between physicians/consultants and families when conflict arises or a change in status occurs that may put up road blocks to a successful transition to the next phase of care.
* **Data Collection:** Case Manager will participate in the collection of information regarding quality improvement activities, risk management issues and reporting this information through appropriate committee structure.

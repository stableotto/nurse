This unique position supports admitted patients who remain in the Emergency Department while awaiting an inpatient bed assignment.

* **Flexible Skill Utilization:** When ED census is low, RNs will float to other acute care inpatient units within the hospital to support staffing needs (no floating outside of the hospital).

**Scope of Responsibilities**


The ED Boarder RN will:

* Provide comprehensive nursing care to admitted patients awaiting inpatient bed placement.
* Perform assessments, medication administration, monitoring, and documentation per inpatient standards of care.

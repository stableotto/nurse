We are looking for a pharmacist (or soon to be pharmacist) to join our team at the beautiful Phoenix Pharmacy in downtown Knoxville. The listing (as it stands now) is for a part time/PRN position with 1\\-2 shifts per week BUT the goal is to grow the position into a full\\-time job over time. That said, we would love a candidate that has a long\\-term view for what this position could become versus what it is now.

**Qualifications:**

1\\. Exceptional customer service is a must.

2\\. Independent work and initiative are a must.

3\\. Great attitude and good sense of humor are required!

4\\. Multitasking is a must.

5\\. Previous pharmacist experience is NOT required to apply.

6\\. If your license is pending passing of the boards this spring/summer, you are still welcome to apply!

**Compensation:**

Like with all independent retail pharmacy, finances are constrained so our hourly rate is NOT competitive with bigger pharmacies. We probably aren’t even competitive with other independent pharmacies in our market either. We hope to increase our compensation over time but know that we are likely the lowest in town.

**Why this job?**

Why would you consider a job with limited hours and low compensation? Glad you asked!

1\\) Our pharmacy is special. No really, it’s one of a kind! Our old school charm, beautiful building and classic soda shop set us apart from your typical community pharmacy and provides a serene and uplifting environment to work in.

2\\) Our clients are wonderful, kind and appreciative. This is a big deal when it comes to retail pharmacy. As such, we have a wonderful atmosphere built on mutual respect between business and customer.

3\\) Our stress level is near zero, especially versus the big guys. We aren’t saying that there won’t be moments, but they pale in comparison to the average retail pharmacy shift.

4\\) We have decent, family\\-friendly hours. We are closed on Sundays, closed on major holidays, and we accommodate personal scheduling needs to the best of our ability.

5\\) We would not expect or ask any candidate to be exclusive to us until we were able to offer full\\-time hours. If you can satisfy the expectations and needs of our shop, we are more than happy to work with you and your other work schedules.

If we haven’t scared you away yet, and if you think you might want to talk about this opportunity a bit more, apply and send us a message about why you think this gig is for you so we can talk more.

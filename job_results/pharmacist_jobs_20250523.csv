In the SC pharmacy, I have estimated that each year (loosely calculated, based on current staff) there are 350\\-400 shifts of PTO available that likely require coverage. Our operating solution is currently to collapse patient care services in some places to support the main pharmacy. I would like to post this strictly on\\-call/PRN position to see if there are any pharmacists willing/looking to work on\\-call in the region and see if they are able to join the MercyOne team. This would better support regular pharmacy services and provide additional redundancy for our workgroup.
